# ChiripitApp

## Project Description

Imagine you have a problem and need to find someone who can help you solve it. Whether you need an electrician for an urgent repair, a plumber to fix a leak, a mechanic for your vehicle, a gardener for your garden maintenance, or even a babysitter for your children, **ChiripitApp** is here to make the search easier.

**ChiripitApp** is a multi-service application designed to connect users with service providers across a wide range of categories. From basic services like electricity and plumbing to more specialized needs like carpentry or delivery services, our app aims to offer a comprehensive solution for finding the service you need, all in one place.

## What is ChiripitApp?

This repository contains the **backend** component of *ChiripitApp*, which serves as the core system for managing all application functionalities. The API developed here is essential for the operation of the application, handling everything from user registration and authentication to profile management, service management, and geolocation to find nearby providers.

The application is intended to be integrated with a frontend developed using **React Native**, focusing on functionality for both Android and iOS devices. This separation between frontend and backend allows for optimal flexibility and scalability, making it easier to maintain and update both components independently.

## API Features

The *ChiripitApp* API provides a range of essential features for the application, including:

- **User Registration and Login:** Allows users to create accounts and securely access the application.
- **Profile Management:** Users can create and manage their profiles, including personal information and preferences.
- **Service Creation and Management:** Service providers can list their services, set prices, and define availability.
- **Geolocation:** Uses the user's location to find nearby service providers and facilitate efficient searches.
- **User and Provider Interaction:** Enables communication between clients and providers, facilitating the hiring and management of services.

## Why ChiripitApp?

The name *ChiripitApp* comes from a local term that refers to the action of earning money by doing various tasks or jobs. This name reflects the essence of the project: to offer a platform where users can quickly find the help they need, and service providers can discover new opportunities to earn money by offering their skills and expertise.
